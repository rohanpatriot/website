There's a persistent myth in product leadership that the best leaders have superior intuition. That they can look at a market, a customer problem, or a set of data and just *know* the right answer.

I've found the opposite to be true.

## The speed of being wrong

The best product leaders I've worked with don't have better intuition — they have better *invalidation speed*. They form hypotheses faster, test them cheaper, and kill them without ego.

This isn't about failing fast in the Silicon Valley platitude sense. It's about building a systematic practice of disconfirmation.

> The measure of a product leader isn't how often they're right. It's how quickly they discover they're wrong.

## Three practices that help

**1. Write the press release first.** Before any spec, write the customer announcement. If you can't articulate why someone would care, the feature isn't ready for investment.

**2. Find the fastest "no."** For every initiative, ask: what's the cheapest thing I can do to prove this *won't* work? Run that experiment first.

**3. Separate decision quality from outcome quality.** Good decisions can produce bad outcomes. Bad decisions can produce good outcomes. Evaluate the process, not just the result.

## The ego problem

The hardest part isn't the methodology — it's the identity. Product leaders are often promoted because they were right about something important. That creates an identity attachment to being right.

The shift is subtle but essential: move from "I need to be right" to "I need to *find* right." The former is about ego. The latter is about craft.

The best product organizations I've seen aren't the ones with the smartest leaders. They're the ones where being wrong is cheap, fast, and completely unremarkable.
