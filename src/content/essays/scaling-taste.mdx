Every product leader eventually faces this tension: the thing that made you effective as an individual contributor — your taste, your eye for detail, your instinct for what feels right — becomes a bottleneck as your team grows.

You can't review every design. You can't approve every copy choice. You can't be in every room where quality decisions are made.

## Taste isn't subjective

The first misconception to dismantle is that taste is purely subjective. It isn't. Taste is pattern recognition refined through deliberate exposure to both excellent and mediocre work.

This means it can be taught. Not through rules — rules produce compliance, not taste — but through shared exposure and shared language.

## Building the taste infrastructure

**Curate a canon.** Collect the 20-30 examples of work that represent the quality bar. Not just your own product — include competitors, adjacent industries, and entirely different domains. Review them together regularly.

**Name the violations.** Create vocabulary for common quality failures. "Feature soup" for unfocused releases. "Lorem ipsum energy" for placeholder-quality copy that shipped. "Pixel debt" for accumulated visual inconsistencies.

**Make reviews generative.** Design reviews shouldn't be approval gates. They should be collaborative sessions where the team develops shared taste through discussion. The goal isn't consensus — it's calibration.

> Taste scales through language, not through control.

## The letting-go paradox

Here's the counterintuitive truth: your taste will scale further if you're willing to let some things ship that don't meet your personal bar. Not everything — there should be a hard floor. But the space between your floor and your ceiling is where your team learns.

Every time someone makes a taste decision you disagree with but can live with, that's growth. That's the system working.

The goal isn't to clone your taste across the organization. It's to create an environment where taste *evolves* — where the team's collective sensibility eventually exceeds what any individual could achieve alone.
