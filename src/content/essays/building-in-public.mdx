Most people think of building in public as a marketing tactic. Share your progress, build an audience, convert followers to customers. That framing undersells it.

Building in public is a *distribution strategy*. And the distinction matters.

## Marketing vs. distribution

Marketing is what you do to get attention for a finished thing. Distribution is the structural advantage that makes attention *find you*. Marketing is a cost. Distribution is an asset.

When you build in public consistently, you're constructing distribution infrastructure:

- **Search surface area.** Every post, every update, every screenshot creates an indexable artifact. Over time, you become findable for problems you're solving.
- **Network density.** People who follow your journey become invested. They share your work not because you asked, but because they feel ownership in the outcome.
- **Trust accumulation.** Showing the messy middle — the wrong turns, the ugly prototypes, the hard decisions — builds a kind of trust that polished launches can't.

## The compound curve

The returns on building in public are backloaded. The first month feels like shouting into a void. The first year feels like slow progress. But somewhere around month 18, the curve bends.

> You don't build an audience. You build a *surface* that an audience accumulates on.

This is why most people quit too early. They're evaluating a compounding strategy with a linear mindset.

## What to share

Not everything. The art is in selection:

**Share decisions, not just outcomes.** "We chose X over Y because Z" is more valuable than "We launched X."

**Share frameworks, not just opinions.** A reusable mental model is worth ten hot takes.

**Share what surprised you.** The unexpected results, the counterintuitive findings, the things that broke your assumptions. These are the posts that spread.

Building in public isn't about vulnerability or transparency for its own sake. It's about creating a structural advantage that compounds over time. The best time to start was a year ago. The second best time is today.
